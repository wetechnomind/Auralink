## 🧾 Coding Standards

To maintain a consistent and professional codebase:

- Prefix all public classes with `Auralink` (e.g., `AuralinkClient`, `AuralinkRequest`).
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines.
- Prefer `async/await` over completion handlers.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Keep code lightweight and dependency-free (Foundation only).
- Add documentation comments (`///`) for public APIs.

## 🧱 Commit Guidelines

Follow a clear commit message format:

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `feat:` | New feature (e.g., `feat: add caching layer`) |
| `fix:` | Bug fix (e.g., `fix: retry logic crash on timeout`) |
| `docs:` | Documentation updates |
| `test:` | Add or modify tests |
| `refactor:` | Code improvement without new features |
| `style:` | Formatting or naming changes |
| `chore:` | Non-code changes (build, CI, etc.) |
